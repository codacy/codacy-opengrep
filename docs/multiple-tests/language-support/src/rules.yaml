    If a dynamic query must be used,leverage nFORCE Query Builder.
    In other programming languages, the related flaw is known as SQL injection.
    Apex doesn't use SQL, but uses its own database query language, SOQL. SOQL is
    much simpler and more limited in functionality than SQL. The risks are much
    lower for SOQL injection than for SQL injection, but the attacks are nearly
    identical to traditional SQL injection. SQL/SOQL injection takes user-supplied
    input and uses those values in a dynamic SOQL query. If the input isn't validated,
    it can include SOQL commands that effectively modify the SOQL statement and trick
    the application into performing unintended commands.

      Every Apex class should have an explicit sharing mode declared. Use the `with sharing`
      or `without sharing` keywords on a class to specify whether sharing rules must be enforced.
      Use the `inherited sharing` keyword on an Apex class to run the class in the sharing mode
      of the class that called it.
